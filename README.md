Why is version / source control important?
when many people work in the code it is hard to track who did what changes, so version control helps with that. Is there major problem/error thanks to version control it is possible to revert to previous state. 
An other reason developer can work on their version without making any changes to original code, so when code is a prove they can merge with put worring if developer changes something important. Companies might want to see who and how much contribution each developer did to a code.
